# 冴えない漫画の育て方

Sae Manga, a minimalist manga reader developed by Liby with love. http://saemanga.com.

The 3.0 version is finally out! Please take a look at the website url above!

# Introduction

Sae Manga is a minimalist manga reader with scrapper from http://cartoonmad.com.

The whole website is built upon [keeling-js](https://github.com/Liby99/keeling-js),
with MongoDB as database and [EJS-Alt](https://github.com/Liby99/ejs-alt) as
render engine.

In 3.0 I rewrote the whole system and completely use keeling-js and ejs-alt.
Now the system has semi-enforced user system, a much more robust front-end and
back-end, and much more user-friendly functionalities such as scaling, managing,
genre filtering and so on. In short future there will be even more great updates.
